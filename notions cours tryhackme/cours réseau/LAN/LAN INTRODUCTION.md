Star Topology : All devices connected to a main one (switch/hub)
Expensive HUB+lots of wires 
if hub broke == all brocken

Bus topology : All devices connected upon a single wire connection (backbone cable) slow because if there is a lot of information the traffic is gonna be bottle necked
Less expensive no hub
if a device broke == still fonctionnable

Ring topoloogy/token topology: computers are connected directly to each others to from a loop
if a wire is cut == all brocken

a switch is use to connect devices
a router is use to connect networks
