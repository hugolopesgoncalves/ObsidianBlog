a packets is the layer above the data layer that that encapsulate the data and ensure that all the frames gonna be correctly transmitted 

in this exemple, i know that technically packets are also data but when i speak about date, i speaks about what the user is trying to transmmit on athers devices on the network 

packets are such as a second envelop over the first envelop where data are stocked

TCP/IP is as OSI model a way of encapsulate datass

 TCP just have 4 layers of encapsulaation so its a summarize version of the osi model

the 3 way handshake
to discuss with onother device on the network, you must establish a connection on both devices
